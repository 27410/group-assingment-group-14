    "Genomic scale models are computational representation of reconstructed networks of an organism of interest. They facilitate optimization of a particular model objective by varying the metabolic flux of intra and extracellular metabolites. There are several E.coli models that are good nominees due to their complete and detailed GEMs that prove to have accurate predictions. Upon investigation of existing models in literature and the BiGG database, three candidates were identified. Models iAF1260, iJO1366, iML1515 were found to be the best ones based on the number of metabolites, reactions and genes as can be seen on Table 1. Being published years apart, the last model iML1515 Sseems to be the most complete based on the model metrics, as well as data incorporated to generate the models. Hence, compared to its predecessor iJO1366, GEM iML1515 includes additional data on protein structure, reactive oxygen species metabolism and metabolite repair pathways. These additions, enable growth simulations on different nutrients base on the E.coli growth data that was collected on 16 different carbon sources. Additionally, across these 16 conditions, iML1515 predicted gene essentiality with an accuracy of 93.4% in comparison with experimental data. "
